# Skin Estuary MOD V2 for KODI 20 Nexus KN Edition #

**Some screenshots You'll find at the end of this Readme**

## Installation Notes ##

It's strongly recommended to install the skin via the "Kodinerds Repo", as this is the only way to guarantee that additional 
required modules (e.g. the PVR Artwork Module) are also installed. Another advantage is that you get automatic updates when 
you install an addon from a repository and not from ZIP.

To install the Kodinerds repository visit the page "https://repo.kodinerds.net", download the repository zip (red button) 
and install it. After that you can install the skin directly from the repository under "Look & Feel", "Skins".

## Installation from Git ##

If you want to install the latest version from Git (before this has added to Kodinerds Repo) just download the Addon from here 
https://github.com/b-jesch/skin.estuary.modv2/tree/Nexus (green Code button), **rename the root folder inside the ZIP** 
from ```skin.estuary.modv2-Nexus``` to ```skin.estuary.modv2``` and choose 'install from zip' inside Kodi. **Renaming 
the root folder inside the ZIP needs unpacking/packing the zip in some cases.**

### File name flagging ###
If you want to use special flags like HDR or Dolby Vision or special 3D formats you have to name your files with proper tags, 
preferably before the file extension: 

| 3D with <br> stereoscopic detection |           MVC codec            |          Side by Side          |         Top and Bottom         |            HDR+ Files            |
|:-----------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|     ![](resources/flags/3d.png)     | ![](resources/flags/3dmvc.png) | ![](resources/flags/3dsbs.png) | ![](resources/flags/3dtab.png) | ![](resources/flags/hdrplus.png) | 
|             no tagging              |             3d.mvc             |             3d.sbs             |             3d.tab             |        hdrplus., .12bit.         |


The HDR type recognition by filename for HDR/HLG/Dolby Vision has been removed.

### Animated Artwork ###

As the setup of animated artwork was done by skinhelper addon (which was removed from skin) the addon "Animated Artwork Module" has now taken 
the management of those artwork. Animated artwork has some limitations (see Kodi Wiki: https://kodi.wiki/view/Artwork_types#Animated_Artwork). 
To get this feature work properly, you have to assign a folder within the addon settings, which contains all the artwork. This 
folder **must** be a folder of your local filesystem. You can use network share, but this **must** be mounted to a local mountpoint.
Put all your artwork into this folder. Subfolders are allowed (without nesting).  

If you navigate in your movie library, you'll have a new entry now to (re)assign animated Artwork in the context menu. The skin
supports animated poster only.
